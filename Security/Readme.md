# :wave: Welcome to the PoC Security Pool 2023 !

During one week, you will discover the different facets of cybersecurity: Network, Web exploit, Cryptography, Reverse engeneering and Forensic

At the end of this pool, you will have the keys to detect and exploit numerous vulnerabilities.

The pool is divided in 2 parts: a training and an application of knowledge.

The training takes place in 5 days, each day will focus on a theme and will be supervised by students with deep knowledge in these areas.

External speakers will also come to bring their experience in the field and explain the main axes of cybersecurity in a company. They will also give you important tips.

## :open_book: Day 1 - Network

In this first day, we will work on network vulnerabilities. We will explain the different facets of this discipline and the different tools that exist.

In this day, we will discover:

- Network notion's : IP, DNS, HTTP(S), logs ...
- Wireshark

[SUBJECT](./day1/)

## :open_book: Day 2 - Reverse

In this second day, we will teach you how to exploit binaries using reverse engineering. You will have to understand what it does and then you will be able to crack it.

In this day, we will discover:

- Python
- GDB / GDB-PEDA

[SUBJECT](./day2/)

## :open_book: Day 3 - Web

In this third day, we will introduce you differents web exploits. We will discover many ways to exploit web applications.

In this day, we will discover:

- BurpSuite

[SUBJECT](./day3/)

## :open_book: Day 4 - Cryptography

In this fourth day, we will introduce you cryptography. We will work a bit more on maths during this day and learn how cryptography use it to encrypt data.

In this day, we will discover:

- Math aspect in cybersecurity (Eliptic curves)
- Encryption (AES)

[SUBJECT](./day4/)

## :open_book: Day 5 - Forensic

In this fifth day, we will introduce you to forensic

In this day, we will discover:

- Autopsy

[SUBJECT](./day5/)

## :alarm_clock: Rush

In groups, you will have to gather all the knowledge gained during these first days and exploit an entire box containing different vulnerabilities.

[SUBJECT](./rush/)
