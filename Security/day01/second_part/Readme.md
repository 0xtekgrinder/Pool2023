Now we will give you a **exploit.pcap** file. You have to exploit it and found several information :

- Who access on the first website in exploit.pcap ? (IPV6)
- A flag seems to be hidden inside the first site. What is it ?
- I was tricked ! Hurry I need to write down the right path of the website before I forgot it !
- I just found a file what it could be ?
- I finally found where he goes at the end, that webiste is very famous ! I'am wondering what he done on it. Maybe I'll find an other file later, I will rest for the moment.

And finally there is a final file to exploit named : **keyboard.pcap**

Good Luck !
