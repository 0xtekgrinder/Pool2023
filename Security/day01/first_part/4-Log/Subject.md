Unfortunately, your server has been compromised by an intruder. Your task is to analyze the provided log file to understand how the attack was carried out and what its impact was.

To complete this exercise, you will need to:

1.  Review the log file to identify any anomalies or suspicious activity. Look for patterns or indicators of an attack, such as repeated login attempts, unexpected network traffic, or unusual system activity.

2.  Determine the cause of the attack by analyzing the log file and any other relevant information. Was the attack the result of a vulnerability in the server software, a misconfigured system, or something else?

3.  Assess the impact of the attack by reviewing the log file and any other available data. Was any sensitive information accessed or modified? Were any services disrupted or disabled?

4.  Based on your analysis, recommend measures to prevent similar attacks in the future. These might include updating software, hardening security configurations, or implementing additional security measures.

Hint: You may find it helpful to use tools such as grep, awk, or sed to search and filter the log file, or to use a log analysis tool such as Logstash or Splunk to process the data.
