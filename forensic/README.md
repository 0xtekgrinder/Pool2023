# 💻 Cybersecurity Forensics Investigation 🔍️

Forensic investigation plays a crucial role in maintaining the security of computer systems and networks. In the event of a security breach or an infection by a malicious software, forensics can help uncover the source of the problem and provide crucial information for resolving it.

In this demonstration, we will use a simulated scenario where a computer user is surprised by a virus to showcase the importance of forensics in cybersecurity.

## 📚 Background 📚

The user, XXX, was using his computer to play a game when he noticed that the computer was running slowly. He suspected that a virus was the cause of the problem. He then took a memory dump of the computer and sent it to the cybersecurity team for investigation.
